I've created a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to analyze Maven train data and identify key challenges and opportunities.

Key Features:

Interactive Filters: Easily filter data by class, ticket type, and month.
Top 10 Routes: Identify the most popular and challenging routes.
Revenue Analysis: Analyze revenue trends by train class and ticket type.
Peak Hour Analysis: Understand passenger demand and resource allocation.

By leveraging this dashboard, you can:

Improve passenger satisfaction: Address issues on frequently delayed or canceled routes.
Increase revenue: Explore opportunities to maximize revenue from different ticket types and classes.
